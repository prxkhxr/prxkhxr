### Prakhar Saxena

Software Engineer at Arista Networks, building scalable network systems and working across Linux, SDN, and platform dedicated system design.
IIT Ropar CSE graduate with prior experience in machine learning and teaching core CS. I enjoy working at the intersection of systems, networking, and intelligent automation—and thrive in environments where I can learn fast and build meaningful things.
Outside of work, I’m curious about robotics, love exploring open-source projects, and am always open to impactful collaborations.
